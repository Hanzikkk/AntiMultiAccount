## # ENGLISH VERSION

### Overview

**AntiMultiAccount** is a simple and lightweight Minecraft plugin designed to detect and manage multiple accounts (alts) on your server. It allows server administrators to mark players as multi-accounts, assign them special ranks, and list all marked players. The plugin supports integration with LuckPerms for rank management and requires a MySQL database to store player data persistently.
